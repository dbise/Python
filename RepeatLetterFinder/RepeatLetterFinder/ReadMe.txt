RepeatLetterFinder.py

Purpose:
This function will take a string as input, find the number of occurences of each char, find the first char that is not repeated, finally take the string and sort it by least number of occurences.

How to run:
1. Run in cmd line or on your own python ide.
2. Run program and it will prompt for a word
3. You will then see the program call the NonRepeat function 
4. The function will automatically print the first occurence of a non repeating letter and the string reconstructed from least to most occurences
